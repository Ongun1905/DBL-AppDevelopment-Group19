We do not have a third-party source used in the app that is unchanged. However, you can find the user scenario for the app down below.

## Citizen User Scenario

Maria is a citizen who lives in a city that is prone to earthquakes. One day, 
while she is at home, she feels the ground shaking violently. She quickly realizes that it's an earthquake and tries to remember what she should do in such a situation. Then she remembers hearing about the Terra app and decides to download it to see if it can help her.


After downloading the app, Maria opens it and is prompted to choose between the citizen or government user type. 
Since she is a citizen, she selects that option and enters her phone number and password to log in. Once she logs in, she is taken to the home page, 
which shows a feed of posts related to the earthquake, sorted by location. 
She sees that there are several posts in her neighborhood, so she taps on the location group to view them.


As Maria scrolls through the posts, she sees one that catches her attention. 
It's a post from a nearby building where people are trapped under the rubble. 
The post has a red cross next to it, which means that her qualifications match the ones required for the post. 


After returning back to the feed page, Maria continues to scroll through the 
posts and sees that there is a shortage of medical professionals in her area. 
She decides to update her qualifications to include first aid, so that she can help in case of medical emergencies. 
She goes back to the qualifications page to update her qualifications to also include first aid and saves it.


Later on, Maria hears from a friend that their neighbor is missing. She opens the app 
and taps on the plus button on the home page to create a new post with the location of her friend's house. 
She adds a brief description of the situation and posts it.


As the situation progresses, Maria checks the Resource Information Page to see if there are any updates about nearby resources or shelters. 
She also checks her Contacts Page to see if any of her friends or family members are using the app and need help. 
If she sees that someone is in danger, she taps on their profile to view their Accident Status Page.


Throughout the whole process, Maria feels reassured by the fact that she can use Terra to get help quickly and efficiently. 
She also feels good knowing that she can contribute to the community by offering her skills and expertise when needed.
